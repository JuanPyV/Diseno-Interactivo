                depends on their answers, we keep or change the modifications. Also we ask for recommendations of the
                design or feedback about our project.

            <h2>The three principles of system design</h2>
            <p class="lead"></p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Early focus on users and tasks: Designer and programmer needs to know who is going to be the user
                      of the project, in order to know what is he going to do. All the needs, behaviors,
                      desires, characteristics.</li>
                  <li>Empirical measurement: in the process of development of the project, making test to see the
                      reactions of the users to certain things to see if they like them or reject them. Then making
                      prototypes to see if the project will be liked.</li>
                  <li>Iterative design: Every time the project is tested, all the errors found on it, are solved or
                      changed. It is like a cycle testing-errors found-fixed. Repeated until no errors are in the
                      project. </li>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p class="lead"> The first thing we want to have, is our information, so everything we plan about can be done.
                This means that we can make our entire website as organized as it needs to be. <br>
                <br>Next step as a team, would be deciding on what kind of focus do we want, how we want our page to look,
                the design we’re thinking and even the theme of it, because of what our webpage is about, we want to be
                sensible on certain topics and obviously we can’t be having a multi-coloured page with rainbows and things
                of the sort. <br>
                <br>After that, we want to start to code all the necessary files and begin the layout of the page, so we can
                start adding the information, adding the styles we might want to use for certain parts and adding everything
                that will make the user experience more enjoyable. <br>
                <br>Finally, as a last step, and a continuous one, would be maintaining the site for as long as it’s needed,
                adding changes to it according to the things we’re being suggested and keeping user experience as the top priority.
