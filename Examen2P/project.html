                <h2>Audience</h2>
                <p class="lead">Previously, we stated our audience to be any person who would drink alcohol, making our
                    range too extensive and inadequate to evaluate. As of now, we’d say that our goal is to approach
                    people who’ve come in contact with alcohol in a bad way, meaning that they now have some sort of
                    problem or dependency with it and need help to get away from it, the age range would still be
                    intact, but now we’d prefer to focus on people with existing problems already.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The motivations of our persona would be to get help to get away from the problem they’re
                        currently on, trying to find an association that can help them, finding information on alcohol
                        and all the risks it has.</li>
                    <li>Their goals are to quit drinking and maintain a healthy balance in their life, keeping alcohol
                        to a minimum or totally quit in.</li>
                    <li>Their frustrations come from the problems they have, and all the inconveniences they get from
                        them, related to their families, friends and the people they know, probably getting shunned away
                        because of their problem.</li>

                <h2>Status of our project</h2>
                <p class="lead"> We applied all the modifications ,into the website, that we received in the feedback of other teams.
                    We added more info from specialists, made it look more attractive to the user. We already did the
                    proposal. We still don’t have the interviews neither the persona.

                <p class="lead"><br><b>Responsive:</b><br>
                    When moving into mobile, the images and the navbar gets moved, all the information and everything
                    else stays in its place and is responsive.</p>
                <p class="lead"><b>Interview:</b></p>
                <p class="lead">We haven’t contacted an expert of the theme as it is, instead, what we have done, has
                    been locating the known groups of people who help others with alcoholism problems, known as A.A.
                    groups, talking with them and their experience with helping, what problems they’ve found when doing
                    it, and cases where they can’t get the person to try and solver their problem. With this information,
                    we were able to determine some better ways to approach this problem, because of how people tend to
                    react if they’re approached like some rabid animal, who can’t control themselves, making them
                    get hurt emotionally and feel like they don’t belong anymore. <br><br>
                    As of the user, we’ve talked with known heavy drinkers, asking them what they would have liked
                    to be able to access back when they still didn’t have such a big problem with this. We also talked
                    on what they liked when looking for information, what they thought wasn’t appropriate to have or
                    talk about in a site like that and some other pieces of information that helped us.

                <h2>Three laws of simplicity</h2>
                <p class="lead">The first law I can sure we surely applied and implemented, was of organization;
                    our intention when designing the webpage was to have our entire information first, and then make a
                    plan to organize it all as it was needed, jointing information together on certain areas to make for
                    an easier read and better experience for whoever is using it. Next, reducing; this part wasn’t as
                    heavily implied in our plan as the previous one, meaning that we didn’t actually talk about making
                    things smaller and easier to access, but what we did, was thinking as an user and how we would like
                    the information to be gathered, like hiding a piece of information with a button, collapsables,
                    having different tabs for the themes we had, and stuff like this that can make the reading of a page
                    much easier and more manageable. Finally, time saving as applied on small things, like introducing
                    pieces of code used on making more efficient information, making it more accessible for users and
                    letting them browse as they like in a small time load webpage, even when having our information
                    in multiple tabs.
