                <h3 class="text-center"><br>   Introduction</h3><br><br>
                <p class="lead">Our project is based on creating a webpage with some functions that‚Äôll help people that
                    have problems with alcohol, age-wide for everyone. We want to offer all kinds of information for
                    whoever reads this site. Having diverse telephones for people to call when in need for help, posting
                    expert opinions on the subject, and offering all kind of consequences if they follow the path they‚Äôre
                    on. That‚Äôs our purpose, to stop this people from going even lower than they are right now, and stopping
                    new people from starting that path.<br><br>

                <h3 class="text-left"><br>   Problem</h3><br><br>
                <p class="lead">Young people start drinking for non-ideal purposes, like following their classmates and
                    friends example just because everyone‚Äôs doing it, and in older people, they‚Äôre heavily inclined to
                    drink to forget their problems and keep on avoiding them. Familiar problems are also a huge reality
                    that make people of all ages start drinking and decrease their life quality.
                    We also believe that people that start drinking just for fun or for simpler reasons, can also fall
                    into this kind of addiction because of a slip, or a few mistakes, so we also want to help them.
                    Having this problem on people causes all sorts of accidents, either in a car accident, aggressive
                    behaviour, or just and overdose, resulting in death.
                    <br><br>

                <h3 class="text-left"><br>   Strategic Goal</h3><br><br>
                <p class="lead">Our project is based on creating a webpage with some functions that‚Äôll help people that
                    have problems with alcohol, age-wide for everyone. We want to offer all kinds of information for
                    whoever reads this site. Having diverse telephones for people to call when in need for help, posting
                    expert opinions on the subject, and offering all kind of consequences if they follow the path they‚Äôre
                    on. That‚Äôs our purpose, to stop this people from going even lower than they are right now, and stopping
                    new people from starting that path.<br><br>


                <h3 class="text-center"><br>        Methodology</h3><br><br>

                <h3 class="text-left"><br>   Implementation Plan</h3><br><br>
                <p class="lead">We plan on first starting with the layout of the page, so we can have everything prepared
                    to start our research. Once everything is laid out and in form, we can start adding every piece of
                    information wanted, numbers, and lastly, our plan would be to add a planned function that works as
                    some sort of alamar to send a message to a previous stated cellphone or institution, so a drunk person
                    can establish a limit for himself.
                    <br><br>

                <h3 class="text-left"><br>   Cost</h3><br><br>
                <p class="lead">We obviously have different costs planned for this, we need to keep our webpage online,
                    so a server is in need to keep it up 24/7. We would also like to keep a direct chat with associations
                    that can send help or chat with someone who has a problem, so that might add an extra cost, making
                    the entire content of this will also generate a cost for our service, transport will also be needed
                    to gather all necessary information. All cost are detailed below:
                    <br>
                </p>
                <ul class="text-left">
                    <li>Domain: 15$ USD</li>
                    <li>Personal service: 90$ USD</li>
                    <li>Server: 100$ USD</li>
                    <li>Maintenance (if needed, cost per year): 80$ USD</li>
                    <li>Extra research: 50$ USD</li>
                    <li>Licenses (if needed): Cost varies between 10$ to a maximum of 200$ USD</li>
                </ul>
