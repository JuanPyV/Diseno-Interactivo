                    <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">“Salvia divinorum” <br>
                        One of the important and interesting solutions I found, as a way of helping with
                        alcoholism, was the use of a species of plant called “Salvia divinorum”, used in
                        a ritual that should help with cases of abuse and addiction of pretty much
                        everything, so using it to cure this problem could work.
                        They believe that the feminine entity that inhabits the plant heals the body,
                        teaches the patient what causes and sustains the addiction, and guides the patient
                        on the road to recovery and a balanced life. <br>
                        <br>"Enforce a minimum price for alcohol" <br>
                        One of the most known solutions that have been tried, was raising the price of
                        alcohol so people would think twice before buying an expensive bottle of wine,
                        tequila, or any variant of beverage that includes this substance. It has proven
                        inefficient all the time it’s been tried because of how people that have fallen
                        into addiction will not stop even for a higher price to buy what they think
                        they need.

                    <h5 class="center">Health problems</h5>

                    <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">This problem is quite
                        evident, leading to possible injuries on one-self, to other people
                        that have nothing to do with that problem, and other kind of
                        injuries that can happen while intoxicated. Alcohol poisoning is
                        one of the most common ones that can happen, especially when
                        dealing with people that don’t drink too often and because of
                        that they exceed on what they drink, leading to the possibility
                        of them dying because of the lack of information on this theme.
                        Physical scars may fade with time, but the psychological ones
                        often stay with you all of your life; how would you feel knowing
                        that you accidentally ended the life of an innocent family?</p>

                    <p class="light" style="text-align: justify;">Being in an intoxicated
                        state can end up causing you all sorts of legal problems, as being
                        in this kind of state, makes you more prone to being aggressive,
                        or making rash decisions in the moment, without thinking of all
                        the possible consequences of your acts.
                        Alcohol-related offences include assault, sexual assault,
                        assault of police, property damage, disorderly or offensive
                        behaviour, hindering police, resisting arrest and drinkdriving.
