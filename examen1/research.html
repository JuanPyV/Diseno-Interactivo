    <div style="text-align: justify;"class="col s12 m4 l8"><p><h4>PROBLEM:</h4> <br> What we want to do, is give a way for people to know all the things that can happen to them if they drink too much beer, or other beverages like those, that include alcohol. If we manage to tell everyone what things will happen if they do this, maybe we’ll be able to solve the problem and avoid all accidents from happening. Even if we couldn’t manage to stop them, we could lead them to people who can help them, or inform their familiars about it, so they can decide what to do with that person</p></div>

    <div style="text-align: justify;"class="col s12 m6 l3"><p><h5>Increasing price:<br></h5>
One of the most popular solutions that have been tried all across the world, has been increasing the price of alcohol, to a bare minimum that wasn’t really cheap. But, as it has proven all the times this been done, doing this will only make people have less money which they can use to buy the other things they need to live, like toiletries, food, and clothes. They’ll always choose to buy what they are addicted to than fulfilling their other bare necessities.
</p></div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"class="col s12 m6 l3"><p><h5>Use of medicinal plants:<br>  </h5>
Something that has been tried (especially on poorer countries) is the use of all kinds of medicinal plants, some of them used in rituals by tribes, and some others even used by professional doctors and researchers. Though this has proven effective in some cases, it’s highly related to the fact that a willing person that also has a profficience to this kind of culture will accept their effects more willingly. Having someone that doesn’t want to be helped or that doesn’t believe in this kind of cure try it, will probably find that it has no effect on him.
</p></div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"class="col s12 m6 l3"><p><h5>Risk factors:</h5> <br/>* Family history of alcohol dependence <br/>* Early life stress in the form of early childhood abuse or neglect. <br/>*Externalizing personality factors (Extroversion, Attention deficit order, Conduct disorder, etc) <br/>* Antisocial and borderline personality disorders among adults</p></div>
    <div style="text-align: justify;"class="col s12 m6 l3"><p>Onset of drinking before the age of 14 years markedly increases risk for later development of alcohol dependence, especially for adolescents with a positive family history.
Because of all this, drinking not only affect the people we normally think of, like adults, people in poverty, and other stereotypes. Having someone on your family that drinks so heavily, WILL make his or her sons have a propense dependance on alcohol, meaning that falling into addiction is way easier for their offsprings, making the roots of this problem more heavily tightened.
