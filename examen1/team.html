<h5>  Daniel<br></h5>
  Quantitative: This first partial, I learn to make a html archive, making grids for a webpage, using all sorts of frameworks to style and create different functions for my webpage, I learnt about frontpage and a backend and how they worked, using javascript to make interactive methods and using github to create a domain for my page.<br>
  Qualitative: I can apply all of these knowledges, to create a webpage customized for the use of anyone, creating a style out of frameworks like materialize, I could make collapsible buttons, a navbar that can show the user its most basic functions like seeing your favorite videos and logging in. While I’ll make sure the front end is well designed and it’s comfortable for everyone to see, I have to write the necessary code for my backend to make all the functions it has to do and work properly. I think I worked for the 100, doing all the work that was needed.<br>

  <br><h4>Personal motivation:</h4><br>
  <h5>  Daniel:<br></h5>
For me, this theme includes some personal stories, as some of my familiars, have had huge problems with all of this. One of them, an uncle that was as kind to his other uncles as one could be, didn’t have a functional family, and ended up taking refugee in drinking as much as he could, which ended up killing him at the short age of 28ish. Having someone close to me dying because of this, made me realize how easy it is to fall into an addiction and having nobody to help you get out of that hole. So for me, making some kind of tool that will even help one person, makes me happy that another family will be safe and complete.<br>

<h5>Mayra:<br></h5>
 Now days, most of the people in society have problem consuming alcohol. For this reason, in this project we want to help informing about the current situation and offer solutions  in order to create a change in the world. The motivation I have is due to the fact that alcohol consuming is very risky, not only for consumers but also to all the people that are around the alcoholic person, around 50% of alcoholic people get this “condition” genetically and if we chance it, people will get their lives changed to be healthier and there won’t be more worries about being affected by this situation or attacked by someone drunk.	<br>

<h5>Juan Pablo:<br></h5>
My motivation for this project came from seeing all the accident that happened daily on all the world, causing people to die in so horrible ways, it made me kind of angry knowing that no real effort was being done to stop this, so trying to make a webpage that can help all of this people, made me insanely happy, knowing that i’d be able to contribute at least a bit to this cause.
